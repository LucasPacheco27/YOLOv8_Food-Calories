This project focuses on leveraging the pre-trained YOLOv8 model to analyze food items through an easy-to-use graphical user interface (GUI). The core objective is to accurately recognize specific food classes and estimate their caloric content in real-time. By providing a user-friendly interface, the project aims to make food analysis accessible and intuitive for everyone. üçéüçï
