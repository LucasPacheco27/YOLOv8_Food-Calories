This project focuses on leveraging the pre-trained YOLOv8 model to analyze food items through an easy-to-use graphical user interface (GUI). The core objective is to accurately recognize specific food classes and estimate their caloric content in real-time. By providing a user-friendly interface, the project aims to make food analysis accessible and intuitive for everyone. üçéüçï

# ‚ú® Key Features

* Food Recognition: The system will use the YOLOv8 object detection model to identify a predefined set of food classes from a live camera feed or image.
* Calorie Estimation: Based on the recognized food items, the project will estimate the approximate caloric value. This estimation will be based on a dataset linking food types to their average caloric content.
* Intuitive GUI: A simple and friendly GUI will be developed to allow users to easily interact with the model, view recognition results, and see the estimated calorie count.
